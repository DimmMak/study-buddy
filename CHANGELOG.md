### 💡 Why this exists
Born inside [ClaudeNotes](https://github.com/DimmMak/claudenotes) as the 9th teammate (DITTO #132). Spun out as a standalone project because the live-co-watching pattern is genuinely novel and useful beyond any one notes system. The combination of (1) live browser observation, (2) personal context awareness, (3) cue-driven reactions, and (4) capture suggestions doesn't exist as a single open-source `.skill` anywhere else as of April 2026.

### 🎯 Design principles
- **Cue-driven, not surveillance.** Speaks only when asked.
- **Local-only privacy.** No network, no telemetry, no backend.
- **Site-extensible.** Adding a new lecture site is ~30 lines of JavaScript.
- **Fallback-friendly.** Works without Tampermonkey via browser MCP scraping (slower, less clean).
